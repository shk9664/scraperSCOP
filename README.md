If using chrome, go to 
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
to download a webdriver for your browser version.

The webdriver needs to match your browser version as well as the operating system being used. 

PLEASE PLACE THE WEBDRIVER IN THE SAME LOCATION AS THE CODE.

If you're running on a Unix-based operating system, you may need to update the permissions of chromedriver after downloading it in order to make it executable:

chmod +x chromedriver
